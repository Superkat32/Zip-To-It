# Zip To It!
## Zip across the lands in style!
### Made for ModFest Toybox!

Use a Zippy Sticky Hand to zip and stick to walls! Upon sticking to a wall, you can jump for some extra height, sneak to simply drop, or zip again to another wall!

You can sneak while zipping to break the sticky hand and cancel the zip. This may be helpful if you get stuck, or want to get some extra height while zipping upwards.

By default, Zippy Sticky hands can zip up to 48 blocks away from your current position. Upon zipping, it reduces fall damage, but doesn't fully negate it!

*Note: Zippy Sticky Hands are supposed to be frog themed, but there isn't a lot of material to work with! Just use your imagination a little ;)*

## Crafting
Zippy Sticky Hands can be crafted by combining:
- A slime ball
- A lead
- Any froglight
Depending on the froglight you use, you'll get a different color Zippy Sticky Hand. From there, you can use any colored Zippy Sticky Hand and a dye to change its color.

## Gamerules

`allowZipcastDuringZipcast` - If enabled, players will be able to use their Zippy Sticky Hands while actively zipping to another location. True by default.

## Zipcaster Item Component

The Zippy Sticky Hand uses the `ziptoit:zipcaster` item component, which allows you to change the Zippy Sticky Hand's zip range, zip speed, and colors.

A better explanation of how to take advantage of this for custom colored zippy sticky hands will be added in the future.
